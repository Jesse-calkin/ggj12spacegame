Hunter instructions

Get rid of mask; add facial features and hair in its place
give him orange hunting jacket
change his pants to either a dark denim blue or camo green
get rid of the large rounded piece at the end of the gun so that it looks like a shotgun
In death animations add in the gun so that it either falls with him or he drops it and it hits the ground
